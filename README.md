# Flatpak Module Declarations

https://flatpak-modules.vercel.app/

This is a listing of commonly used dependencies in Flatpak app. To add a dependency to your project, you can copy the JSON or YAML declaration and paste it into the `modules` list of your Flatpak manifest.

The list is very short at the moment. If you need anything added, raise an issue here, and I will try to add it. If you already know the declaration for a module, feel free to edit [`public/modules.json`](https://github.com/dar5hak/flatpak-modules/blob/main/public/modules.json) and make a pull request.

## Development

**TL;DR:** `npm run dev`

This is a static Svelte app. Provided you have Node.js installed, you can run it locally with the following steps:

1. Clone the repo and `cd` into the directory.
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run dev`
